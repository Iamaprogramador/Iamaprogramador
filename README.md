- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Iamaprogramador
Iâ€™m interested in writing HTML/CSS, and small-scale C programs, as well as fun small programs for graphing calculators (mostly the CE)
Iâ€™m currently learning C on my Rpi4, and C for the CE.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on widely-used and higher-scale projects for the CE, such as MateoConLechuga's Cesium shell and calc84maniac's TI-Boy CE.
You can reach me at iamaprogramador, view my (basically nonexistent) projects on my website, and see videos of my projects at my YouTube channel, Iamaprogramador
